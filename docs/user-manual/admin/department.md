### Creating a Department

To create a new department within the university's administrative system, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the administrative dashboard using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Manage Department" section from sidebar by clicking at your profile icon at the top right of screen.
3. Look for the option to "Add Department" and select it.

You will be prompted to provide the following information:

- Department Name: Enter a descriptive name for the new department (e.g., "Department of Computer Science Engineering").
- Department Code Name: Input a unique code name or abbreviation for the department (e.g., "CSE" for Computer Science Engineering).

4. After filling in the required details, submit the form.

The system will process your request and create the new department. Make sure to confirm that the department details are accurate before finalizing the creation. You will be notified whether the department is created successfully or not.

### Deleting a Department

If a department becomes redundant or needs to be removed for any reason, you can delete it by following these steps:

1. Log in to the administrative dashboard using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Manage Department" section from sidebar by clicking at your profile icon at the top right of screen.
3. Locate the department you wish to delete from the list of existing departments.

Ensure you have considered the implications of deleting a department, as it may result in the removal of associated courses, faculty members, and other related data.

4. Click the delete icon beside the department that you want to delete.

Before proceeding, take note of the following:

- Deleting a department is irreversible and will result in the removal of all associated data like courses and sections.
- Be certain that the department is no longer needed and all required data has been backed up or transferred.

The system will initiate the deletion process and remove the department from the administrative system. Be aware that this action cannot be undone. You will be notified whether the department is deleted successfully or not.

## Conclusion

Efficient department management is crucial for maintaining the organizational structure of the university. By creating departments with clear names and code names, and by responsibly deleting departments when necessary, you contribute to the overall effectiveness of the institution's administrative operations.
