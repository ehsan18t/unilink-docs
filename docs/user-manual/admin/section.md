### Creating and Managing Sections

To manage sections for specific courses within the university's academic system, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the administrative dashboard using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Manage Courses" section from the sidebar by clicking on your profile icon at the top right of the screen.
3. Locate the course for which you want to manage sections and click on its title. You will be redirected to a page displaying the list of sections for that course.

On this page, you will find a list of existing sections for the selected course along with options to add or remove sections.

### Adding a New Section

To create a new section for the selected course, follow these steps:

1. On the course's section management page, look for the option to "Add New Section" and select it.
2. You will be prompted to provide the following information:

   - Section Name: Enter a descriptive name for the new section (e.g., "Section A").
   - Trimester Code: Input a code representing the trimester/semester in which the section will be offered (e.g., "TRM201, SEM201").

3. After filling in the required details, submit the form.

The system will process your request and create the new section. Make sure to confirm that the section details are accurate before finalizing the creation. You will receive a notification indicating whether the section was successfully created or not.

### Removing a Section

If a section becomes unnecessary or needs to be removed, you can delete it by following these steps:

1. On the course's section management page, locate the section you wish to delete from the list of existing sections.
2. Click the delete icon next to the section that you want to remove.

Before proceeding, take note of the following:

- Deleting a section will result in the removal of all associated data like enrolled students and class schedules.
- Be certain that the section is no longer needed and all necessary data has been backed up or transferred.

3. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

The system will initiate the deletion process and remove the section from the administrative system. This action is irreversible. You will be notified whether the section is deleted successfully or not.

### Adding Faculty to a Section

To assign faculty members to a section, follow these steps:

1. On the course's section management page, locate the desired section for which you want to add faculty.
2. Click the "Add Faculty to Section" button. You will be directed to a new page showing a list of available faculty members.

3. From the dropdown menu, select the faculty member you want to add to the section.

4. Click the "Add" button to assign the selected faculty member to the section.

The system will update the section's faculty list accordingly. You will receive a notification indicating whether the faculty member was successfully added to the section.


## Conclusion

Effective section management is crucial for organizing course offerings and student enrollment. By creating sections with informative names and associating them with the appropriate trimester codes, and by responsibly removing sections when required, you contribute to the smooth functioning of the university's academic processes.
