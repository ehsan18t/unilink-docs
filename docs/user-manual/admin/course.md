### Creating a Course

To add a new course to the university's academic offerings, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the administrative dashboard using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Manage Courses" section from the sidebar by clicking on your profile icon at the top right of the screen.
3. Look for the option to "Add Course" and select it.

You will be prompted to provide the following information:

- Course Title: Enter a descriptive title for the new course (e.g., "Introduction to Computer Science").
- Course Code: Input a unique code or abbreviation for the course (e.g., "CSE111").
- Department: Choose the relevant department for the course from the dropdown menu. This should be a department that has been created previously.

4. After entering the required details, submit the form.

The system will process your request and create the new course. Ensure that the course details are accurate before finalizing the creation. You will be notified whether the course is successfully created or not.

### Deleting a Course

If a course becomes obsolete or needs to be removed for any reason, you can delete it by following these steps:

1. Log in to the administrative dashboard using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Manage Courses" section from the sidebar by clicking on your profile icon at the top right of the screen.
3. Locate the course you wish to delete from the list of existing courses.

Ensure you have considered the implications of deleting a course, as it may result in the removal of associated data like sections and enrollment records.

4. Click the delete icon next to the course that you want to delete.

Before proceeding, take note of the following:

- Deleting a course is irreversible and will result in the removal of all associated data.
- Be certain that the course is no longer needed and all necessary data has been backed up or transferred.

The system will initiate the deletion process and remove the course from the administrative system. This action cannot be undone. You will be notified whether the course is deleted successfully or not.

## Conclusion

Efficient course management contributes to the university's academic structure. By creating courses with informative titles, unique codes, and proper department assignments, and by responsibly deleting courses when needed, you play a key role in maintaining the quality and relevance of the institution's educational offerings.
