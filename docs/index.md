## Problems

Many universities lack official community websites primarily due to the substantial resources and funding required for their development and ongoing maintenance. Building and sustaining a community site entails significant costs, including technological infrastructure, personnel, and regular updates. For most universities, investing in such a system poses a considerable financial burden,especially considering that there may not be a direct financial return on investment. So we are trying to develop a platform where university can register and create their own forum and official community. Using this platform the university admin can monitor the whole system without any kind of hassle and also use it in a easy manner. One student/faculty can post important stuff and also  share necessary information here. As social media does create a huge level of distraction our platform will also be able to avoid that distraction and keep the concentration on the necessary things. 


## Features to Solve Problems

???+ tip "Adaptive"
    The first major feature is ”Adaptive”. This remarkable functionality allows our application to
    seamlessly integrate with universities. Any university can adopt our services, granting immediate access to
    all the features we provide, including forums, chat, and more to their students and faculties. Additionally,
    the data of each university remains completely separate. For instance, when a user from UIU posts some-
    thing in a forum, it remains exclusive to UIU students. Each university operates as an independent entity,
    ensuring privacy and tailored experiences.


??? Classroom
    We are excited to introduce ”Classroom”, a cool feature that functions as a faculty-managed and controlled group chat. Each course section automatically forms its own designated group, eliminating the previous hassle of manually collecting IDs to create groups. This streamlined approach enhances collaboration and communication within the academic community.


??? abstract "Forum"
    Naturally, forums are an integral part of our community app. We provide diverse forums where students can freely share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences. Each forum is moderated by a faculty member, ensuring that the content remains relevant and appropriate.
