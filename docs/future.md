# Future Plan


In future we have a very big plan working with our this project. As we didn't complete that much in this session we are hoping to develop this project in our 
**Final Year Design Project** and take it to the next step and deploy this project in real life so that the problems we have addressed can be solved throughout our project. 

**Tentative Features for Future**

??? Alumni-Section
    We want to keep a section for ”Alumni”
    where the alumnis can share their thoughts regarding the job market place and also guide their juniors for the better future. This will create a big oppurtunity for the Ex-Students to stay connected with the people of university in a productive manner. 


??? Club
     Via UniLink we would like to  incorporate a club feature, offering an alternative to traditional social media platforms.
     Clubs can promote their events and engage with users within the app,   allowing students to stay connected
     and informed while moving away from conventional social media.


??? Progress-Tracking
     We will try to keep a "Progress Tracking" feture that will be able to track a students process depending on his/her previous results. This feature empowers students to easily monitor
     their educational journey with the guidance of faculty members. They can view their tracked data in a
     meaningful way, gaining valuable insights into their results, areas for improvement, and where to focus their
     efforts, all at a glance. We will try to intrigrate the feature of "Machine Learning" for implementing this feature.
